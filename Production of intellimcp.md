Production of intellimcp_dev

Productionizing the IntelliMCP Studio involves several key steps to move from our current development setup to a stable, secure, and scalable deployment. Here’s a breakdown of the main areas:
Deployment Strategy:
Frontend (Next.js): Choose a hosting platform. Vercel is specifically designed for Next.js and is highly recommended. Others include Netlify, AWS Amplify, Render.
Backend (FastAPI): Needs a place to run the Python server. Options include:
Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) like Render, Heroku, Google App Engine.
Container platforms like AWS Fargate, Google Cloud Run, or Kubernetes (more complex).
Serverless functions (AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions), though these might require adapting the FastAPI app slightly.
Database (PostgreSQL): Use a managed database service. Options: AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL, Supabase, Neon, Render PostgreSQL, Heroku Postgres. Avoid running your own DB server unless necessary.
Vector Store (ChromaDB): This needs persistent storage. You can run it in a Docker container alongside your backend on your chosen host, ensuring its data volume (chroma_data) is persisted correctly.
Environment Configuration & Secrets:
Strict Separation: Use distinct environment variables for development, staging (optional), and production.
Secrets Management: Crucially, move sensitive keys (CLERK_SECRET_KEY, OPENAI_API_KEY, DB_PASSWORD) out of .env files and into the secure environment variable/secrets management system provided by your chosen hosting platforms (e.g., Vercel Environment Variables, Render Secrets, AWS Secrets Manager). Never commit secrets to Git.
Frontend Variables: Set NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY and NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_API_URL in the frontend deployment environment. NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_API_URL must point to the live URL of your deployed backend API.
Backend Production Configuration:
CORS: Tighten the origins list in backend/main.py to only include your deployed frontend URL(s). Remove localhost/127.0.0.1.
Process Management/Workers: Run Uvicorn using a process manager like Gunicorn (gunicorn main:app -w 4 -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker) to handle multiple concurrent requests effectively. The number of workers (-w 4) depends on server resources.
Logging: Configure proper logging (e.g., structured JSON logs) and potentially send logs to a dedicated service (Datadog, Sentry, CloudWatch) instead of just printing to the console.
Dependencies: Ensure requirements.txt has pinned versions for stability.
Database Migrations:
Remove drop_all: We've already removed the destructive drop_all from database.py.
Implement Migrations: Set up a migration tool like Alembic. This allows you to safely apply future database schema changes (like adding new columns or tables) without losing data. This involves initializing Alembic in your backend project and generating migration scripts whenever you change your SQLModel definitions in models.py.
Frontend Build:
Deploy the optimized production build of the Next.js app (created via npm run build or yarn build).
Security Hardening:
HTTPS: Ensure all services are served over HTTPS (usually handled by hosting platforms).
Dependency Scans: Regularly check dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
Rate Limiting: Consider adding rate limiting to your FastAPI backend APIs to prevent abuse.
JWKS Validation: Implement proper fetching, caching, and validation using Clerk's JWKS endpoint in auth_utils.py instead of skipping signature verification.
CI/CD (Recommended):
Set up a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) to automate testing, building, and deploying your frontend and backend whenever you push changes.
Monitoring & Alerting (Recommended):
Integrate basic monitoring (uptime checks) and error tracking (like Sentry) to be notified of issues in production.
Immediate Next Steps (Based on our development):
Implement Database Migrations: Set up Alembic for the backend.
Configure Hosting: Choose your hosting providers and set up environments.
Manage Secrets: Move all secrets from .env files to your hosting provider's secret management.
Update CORS & URLs: Set the correct production frontend URL in backend CORS and the correct production backend URL in the frontend environment variables.
Deploy!
Which of these productionizing steps would you like to focus on first? Setting up database migrations (Alembic) is a very important one to do before making further model changes.

<----Using Vercel, Render, Superbase. --->
Need to update Clerk Keys

Okay, that's a solid stack choice for deployment:
Vercel: Excellent for hosting the Next.js frontend. It integrates well with Git, handles builds, and offers serverless functions (though we might not need them directly here).
Render: Great for hosting the FastAPI backend (as a Web Service) and potentially the ChromaDB instance (as a Docker container with a persistent disk). It simplifies infrastructure management.
Supabase: Provides a managed PostgreSQL database, handling backups, scaling, etc., which is perfect for our needs.
Here's the high-level plan and the immediate code changes needed:
I. Code Modifications for Deployment:
Centralize ChromaDB Client Initialization: Just like we did for LLMs (llm_services.py), let's centralize ChromaDB client creation to make it configurable for Render.
Create backend/vector_store_services.py.
Define a function like get_vector_store() inside it. This function will try to connect to a ChromaDB server using environment variables (CHROMA_HOST, CHROMA_PORT). If those aren't set, it will fall back to the local persistent directory (./chroma_data).
Update ingestion.py and generation.py (and context.py if it uses Chroma directly) to get the Chroma client/vector store via this new service function (using FastAPI Depends where appropriate).
Database Connection URL: Modify backend/database.py to prioritize using a single DATABASE_URL environment variable if it exists (this is standard practice and how platforms like Render and Supabase often provide connection info). It can fall back to constructing it from individual parts (DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD, etc.) if DATABASE_URL isn't set.
CORS Update: Add placeholders for your future Vercel production URL(s) in the origins list in backend/main.py.
Environment Variable Setup: We'll need to define expected environment variables for production (e.g., in a .env.example file or just document them).
II. Platform Setup (High-Level):
Supabase:
Create a new project on Supabase.
Get the PostgreSQL connection string (looks like postgresql://postgres:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@[YOUR-HOST]:5432/postgres).
Render:
Backend Service: Create a "Web Service" on Render, link it to your Git repository (backend directory).
Set Build Command: pip install -r requirements.txt
Set Start Command: gunicorn main:app -w 4 -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT (Render provides the $PORT variable).
Set Environment Variables:
DATABASE_URL: Paste the connection string from Supabase.
CLERK_SECRET_KEY: Your Clerk secret key.
OPENAI_API_KEY: Your OpenAI key.
CHROMA_HOST: The hostname of your ChromaDB service (see next point).
CHROMA_PORT: The port of your ChromaDB service (usually 8000).
ChromaDB Service (Option 1 - Docker): Create a "Private Service" on Render using Docker.
Use an official ChromaDB Docker image (if available) or create a simple Dockerfile.
Crucially: Attach a Persistent Disk to this service and mount it to /chroma_data inside the container. This ensures your vector data isn't lost on restarts.
Note the internal service address (e.g., chroma-db) provided by Render – this becomes your CHROMA_HOST environment variable for the backend service.
ChromaDB Service (Option 2 - Managed Vector DB): Explore if Render or another provider offers a managed vector database compatible with ChromaDB's client API. This might be simpler but potentially more costly.
Vercel:
Create a new project on Vercel, link it to your Git repository (frontend directory).
Set Environment Variables:
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY: Your Clerk publishable key.
CLERK_SECRET_KEY: Your Clerk secret key (Vercel needs this for server-side auth helpers).
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_API_URL: The live URL of the backend service deployed on Render (e.g., https://your-backend-name.onrender.com).

You're absolutely right, we will need production keys from Clerk.
1. Clerk Production Keys:
In your Clerk Dashboard, you likely have separate "Development" and "Production" instances, or at least separate API Keys sections.
Go to the Production instance/keys section.
You will find a Production Publishable Key (starts with pk_live_...) and a Production Secret Key (starts with sk_live_...).
These live keys are the ones you will use in the environment variables for your deployed services on Vercel and Render, respectively. Never use your test keys in production.
2. Deployment Steps (One by One):
Let's start with the database using Supabase.
Create Supabase Project:
Go to supabase.com and sign in or create an account.
Click "New project".
Choose an organization, give your project a name (e.g., intellimcp-prod), generate a strong database password (save this securely!), and choose a region close to your users or your backend server.
Select the "Free" plan for now (it's quite generous).
Wait for the project to be created (takes a minute or two).
Get Database Connection String:
Once the project is ready, navigate to Project Settings (gear icon in the left sidebar).
Go to the Database section.
Under "Connection string", copy the URI that looks like postgresql://postgres:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@[YOUR-HOST]:5432/postgres.
Important: Replace [YOUR-PASSWORD] with the actual strong database password you created earlier.
Save this full connection string securely. This is the DATABASE_URL you will need for your Render backend service.
Let me know when you have successfully created the Supabase project and copied the database connection string (with your password inserted). Then we'll move on to setting up database migrations with Alembic.
